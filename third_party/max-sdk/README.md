# max-sdk

The Traditional Max Software Development Kit contains the API (headers, source, libraries) for building external objects (plug-ins) in C for [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max-features). It additionally includes documentation of the API and example projects using the Xcode and Visual Studio development environments.

The SDK is structured as a Max package. Simply place the SDK in your `Max 8/Packages` folder to begin working.

## c++ api

If you are interested in using Modern C++ to write external objects, please take a look at the [Min DevKit](https://github.com/Cycling74/min-devkit).

## testing

It is highly recommended that you test your code thoroughly. One option is use the [max-test](https://github.com/Cycling74/max-test) package.
